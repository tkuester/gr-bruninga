       *
       * Each radio's FM pre-emphasis filter is unique. As such, this results
       * in the amplitudes of each tone varying transmission to transmisison.
       * This block forms a "moving average" between the peaks and valleys,
       * and scales the waveform appropriately.
       *
       * The algorithm is simple. If we see a "peak" (or valley) beyond the
       * current average, we do:
       *     new_peak = (sample * attack) + (old_peak * (1 - attack))
       *
       * Therefore, setting the attack parameter to "1.0" means the average
       * instantly becomes the sample value when greater than the current
       * average.
       *
       * If the sample is within the current average, we replace "attack" with
       * decay.
       *
       * The peak and valley waveforms are sent out to (optional) ports, which
       * can be plotted alongside the input waveform for confirmation of
       * parameter choice.
       *
       * Attack and decay are specified in floating point numbers between
       * 0.0 and 1.0. It is possible to set the numbers outside this range,
       * although behavior will likely be detrimental.
